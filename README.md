Clone: Clone creates a copy of an existing Git repository, including its entire history and all branches, on your local machine.

Commit: A Commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, capturing the state of all tracked files.

Fetch: Fetch retrieves updates from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch, allowing you to review changes before integrating them.

GIT: GIT is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project.

Github: Github is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, providing tools for collaborative software development and project management.

Merge: Merge combines changes from different branches into a single branch, integrating the work done separately.

Merge Conflict: A Merge Conflict occurs when changes from different branches conflict with each other and Git cannot automatically resolve them.

Push: Push uploads your local repository changes to a remote repository, making them available to others.

Pull: Pull fetches updates from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch, keeping your local copy up-to-date.

Remote: A Remote is a version of your repository hosted on the internet or another network, allowing collaboration with others.

Repository: A Repository is a storage location for your projectâ€™s files and their revision history, managed by Git.
