Commit: A Commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, capturing the state of all tracked files.

Fetch: Fetch retrieves updates from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch, allowing you to review changes before integrating them.

GIT: GIT is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project.

Github: Github is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, providing tools for collaborative software development and project management.

Merge: Merge combines changes from different branches into a single branch, integrating the work done separately.

Merge Conflict: A Merge Conflict occurs when changes from different branches conflict with each other and Git cannot automatically resolve them.

Push: Push uploads your local repository changes to a remote repository, making them available to others.

Pull: Pull fetches updates from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch, keeping your local copy up to date.
